As we were leaving school she said  &quot;so all   the  singing lessons with Virg have paid    off&quot;. She is so excited, I told her I would let you know, as she wanted you to be the first to hear. Many thanks Virg, you have been very kind to Emily   this year.</p>

            <p>To Whom It May Concern</p>
            <p>I am HOD Music at New Plymouth Boys High School. Recently we were fortunate enough to have Virginia Humphrey-Taylor present a series of workshops on voice &amp; essential techniques to singing well for Taranaki Secondary Schools Choirs. </p>
            <p>Virginia is a gifted vocalist and teacher. With her intimate knowledge of vocal technique, she completely engaged the students, giving them a hands-on experience as they absorbed information about the voice and explored how to  use the voice to best effect. </p>
            <p>Virginia has a dynamic and energetic presentation. She instils confidence in her participants. The students were thoroughly inspired and excited about singing and they implemented her ideas with enthusiasm. Virginia encouraged self-expression in a supportive listening environment, exploring news ways of using the voice and developing an understanding of the mechanics of singing in a new and exciting way. </p>
            <p>It was a wonderful experience and I unreservedly recommend to others these series of workshops. Virginia will inspire, excite, re-ignite a love of singing and expose a creativity amongst  students that may not otherwise be realised! </p>
            <p>Thank you to Virginia for giving us this opportunity!</p>
